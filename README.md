## **Feature Comparison Chart**

### **Core Authentication Methods**

# Firebase vs Amazon Cognito for Server-Side Dart SDK

This document provides a high-level comparison of Firebase Authentication and Amazon Cognito features tailored for building a server-side Dart SDK. The goal is to evaluate how a server-side Dart SDK could integrate Amazon Cognito and compare its capabilities to Firebase Authentication.


## **Feature Comparison Chart**

### **Core Authentication Methods**

| Firebase Method                                  | Amazon Cognito Equivalent                       | Notes                                                                                  | Supported |

| `FirebaseAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword()`      | Cognito Admin: `AdminInitiateAuth`             | Authenticate user with email and password. Server-side API supports admin privileges.  | ✅         |
| `FirebaseAuth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword()`  | Cognito Admin: `AdminCreateUser`               | Server-side method to create a new user in the user pool.                              | ✅         |
| `FirebaseAuth.signOut()`                         | Not Applicable                                 | Cognito does not provide server-side logout; tokens must be invalidated by the client. | ❌         |
| `FirebaseAuth.setPersistence()`                  | Not Applicable                                 | Token persistence is a client-side feature.                                            | ❌         |
| `FirebaseAuth.sendPasswordResetEmail()`          | Cognito Admin: `AdminResetUserPassword`        | Sends a reset password request to the user.                                            | ✅         |
| `FirebaseAuth.connectAuthEmulator`               | Not Applicable                                 | Cognito does not support emulated authentication environments.                         | ❌         |

## **Key Differences Between Firebase and Amazon Cognito**

1. **Server-Side Capabilities:** Amazon Cognito provides robust server-side APIs (e.g., Admin APIs), while Firebase is primarily client-focused.
2. **Enterprise Features:** Cognito supports advanced features like Lambda triggers and adaptive authentication, which are absent in Firebase.
3. **Custom Token Support:** Firebase enables custom token generation for integration with external systems, while Cognito lacks this feature.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Design the Dart SDK for server-side integration with Amazon Cognito Admin APIs.
2. Implement key features such as user management, MFA, and token management.
3. Provide documentation and examples to facilitate adoption for both mobile and web developers.
