## **Feature Comparison Chart**

### **Core Authentication Methods**

# Firebase vs Transmit for Server-Side Dart SDK

This document provides a high-level comparison of Firebase Authentication and Transmit features tailored for building a server-side Dart SDK. The goal is to evaluate how a server-side Dart SDK could integrate Transmit and compare its capabilities to Firebase Authentication.


## **Feature Comparison Chart**

### **Core Authentication Methods**

| Firebase Method                                  | Transmit Equivalent                       | Notes                                                                                  | Supported |

| `FirebaseAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword()`      | transmit Admin: `AdminInitiateAuth`             | Authenticate user with email and password. Server-side API supports admin privileges.  | ✅         |
| `FirebaseAuth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword()`  | transmit Admin: `AdminCreateUser`               | Server-side method to create a new user in the user pool.                              | ✅         |
| `FirebaseAuth.signOut()`                         | Not Applicable                                 | transmit does not provide server-side logout; tokens must be invalidated by the client. | ❌         |
| `FirebaseAuth.setPersistence()`                  | Not Applicable                                 | Token persistence is a client-side feature.                                            | ❌         |
| `FirebaseAuth.sendPasswordResetEmail()`          | transmit Admin: `AdminResetUserPassword`        | Sends a reset password request to the user.                                            | ✅         |

## **Key Differences Between Firebase and Transmit**

1. **Server-Side Capabilities:** Transmit provides robust server-side APIs (e.g., Admin APIs), while Firebase is primarily client-focused.
2. **Enterprise Features:** transmit supports advanced features like Lambda triggers and adaptive authentication, which are absent in Firebase.
3. **Custom Token Support:** Firebase enables custom token generation for integration with external systems, while transmit lacks this feature.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Design the Dart SDK for server-side integration with Transmit Admin APIs.
2. Implement key features such as user management, MFA, and token management.
3. Provide documentation and examples to facilitate adoption for both mobile and web developers.
